# Covid-19-in-India-Dashboard-
I created a Dashboard with Tableau about covid-19 cases in India. Here I have used multiple data sources(6 datasets). Used measure names and dual axis to create a multiple line chart and many other techniques
This project presents an interactive visual analytics dashboard for monitoring the spread and impact of COVID-19 across India. The dashboard provides insights into confirmed cases, recoveries, deaths, state-wise distributions, trends over time, and comparisons.
