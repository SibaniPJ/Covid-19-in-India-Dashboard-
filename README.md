# Covid-19-in-India-Dashboard-
I created a Dashboard with Tableau about covid-19 cases in India. Here I have used multiple data sources(6 datasets). Used measure names and dual axis to create a multiple line chart and many other techniques
This project presents an interactive visual analytics dashboard for monitoring the spread and impact of COVID-19 across India. The dashboard provides insights into confirmed cases, recoveries, deaths, state-wise distributions, trends over time, and comparisons.
 Project Overview
During the pandemic, data played a crucial role in understanding the evolving situation.


This dashboard helps users quickly analyze:

         Daily and cumulative confirmed, recovered, and death cases

         State-wise comparison of COVID-19 impact

         Trend analysis using multi-line charts

         Visual interaction through filters and highlights

## Data Sources
I have used 6 different datasets (CSV format) containing:

Interactive Filters for:
    Date Range
    State Selection
Map Visualization to compare severity among states
KPIs / Summary Cards showing high-level statistics
